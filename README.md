## Query loan database with SQL
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL. I query three different tables using SQL with JOINS and calculated fields. 
The tables include merchant categories, merchant names and loan performance. The tables have been imported in MySQL and the queries are written in Python.
